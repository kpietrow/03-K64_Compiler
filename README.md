Compiler
========

Building a compiler in Ruby, with the eventual goal of taking a custom grammar and converting it to machine code.

The Lexer is currently tentatively finished, and so now the mysteries of parsing await!


To run the compiler, run this command in the terminal:

$ ruby main.rb name_of_test_file

ex: $ ruby main.rb Test/test1.txt
